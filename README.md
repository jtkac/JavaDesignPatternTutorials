# JavaDesignPatternTutorials

Java is advantageous over Kotlin and React in the case where you are required to operate offline and are dealing with databases and data storage. Kotlin, because of a repeatable work-related defect in Java, adds a base reflection time to processing transport languages (such as JSON or XML) which, in Java, amounts to .004 additional seconds per record. Kotlin solves this by applying the fastest reflection time available. Java can still be used to explicitly declare what to expect from transport languages which gets rid of the times associated with Kotlin's reflection. Given we are dealing with a few records up to about 100,000 this time may seem unnoticable. There does however exist a niche case which correlates to records beyond 100,000 where reflection may be optimally refactored out by reverting Kotlin to Java in offline based environments.

Given we are reverting back to Java, I spent some time compiling a list of the best or free-est or, in the case of databases, quickest but potentially paid additions respective of traditional Java lifecycle.
